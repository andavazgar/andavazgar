I am a self-motivated web and mobile developer. I strive to continuously learn new technologies and improve my abilities as a programmer. I have experience developing applications using Java, PHP, Swift, JavaScript and TypeScript.

In the last few years, I have learned how to develop mobile applications by following great online resources. Most notably, I completed the following courses:

- Stanford Universityâ€™s CS193p: Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI ([cs193p.sites.stanford.edu](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu))
- 100 Days of Swift & 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson ([hackingwithswift.com](https://hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui))
- React Native courses by Code with Mosh ([codewithmosh.com](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-react-native-course)) and Design+Code ([designcode.io](https://designcode.io/react-native))

Some of the projects that I completed during these courses can be found below.

After completing said courses, I decided build an iOS app called MovieTime. This app has helped me further develop my programming skills as well as my knowledge in the area of mobile development.


## MovieTime ([See more information](https://github.com/andavazgar/MovieTime))
MovieTime is an app that uses The Movie Database API (TMDB) to allow users to keep track of the movies they want to watch (Watchlist) and where they can watch them (Streaming services).
