I am a Computer Science graduate from Concordia University. My biggest passion is mobile app development; primarily, iOS (Swift).

Being able to create apps that help people achieve a goal is extremely rewarding. Because of this, I decided to learn how to build iOS apps (Swift, SwiftUI and UIKit) by following great online resources. Most notably, I completed the following courses:

- Stanford University | CS193p: Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI (by Professor Paul Hegarty)
- 100 Days of Swift and SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (Hacking with Swift)

All of the code that I wrote (theory, challenges and assignments) for said courses can be found on my GitHub page.

With the knowledge I acquired from these courses, I developed the MovieTime App ðŸ˜„


## MovieTime App ([See more information](https://github.com/andavazgar/MovieTime))
MovieTime is an app that uses The Movie Database API (TMDB) to allow users to keep track of the movies they want to watch (Watchlist) and where they can watch them (Streaming services).
